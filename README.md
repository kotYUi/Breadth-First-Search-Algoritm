# Explanation of the wide search algorithm (BFS) using the example of searching for a best friend
Давайте разберем ваш код шаг за шагом и визуализируем его работу.


First we have the dictionaryNamesFriend dictionary, which represents the friends graph as an adjacency list:

python
{
    "I": ["Lisa", "Maria", "Muara", "Jon"],
    "Lisa": ["I", "Jason", "Mikel", "I'm at home"],
    "Mikel": ["Jon", "Lisa", "Dima"],
    "Potur": ["Artem", "Katya", "Maksim"]
}
Визуализация графа
Вот как выглядит этот граф:

[I] ---Lisa ---Jason
 |       /  \
 | / Mikel---Dima
 |     /      |
Maria / Jon
 |   /
Muara
 |
Jon

[Potur] --- Artem
 |     \
 | Katya
 |       \

Breadth-first Search Algorithm (BFS)
The breadth_first_search function implements the BFS algorithm for searching for a "best friend" (a person whose name begins with "J").

# Algorithm Steps:
Creating a queue (deque) to store people who need to be checked
Adding all the friends of the initial person to the queue
Creating a set to track people who have already been verified
While the queue is not empty:
Removing the first person from the queue
If it hasn't been checked yet:
Checking if he is a best friend (name starts with "J")
If yes, we return success.
If not, add all his friends to the end of the queue and mark him as verified.

# Execution example for breadth_first_search("I"):
Initial queue: ["Lisa", "Maria", "Muara", "Jon"]
Checking the "Lisa":
The name does not start with a "J"
Adding Lisa's friends: ["I", "Jason", "Mikel", "Evdacim"]
Now it's your turn: ["Maria", "Muara", "Jon", "I", "Jason", "Mikel", "Evdacim"]
Checking out "Maria":
Doesn't start with a "J"
Maria has no friends in the dictionary (get returns [])
Queue: ["Muara", "Jon", "I", "Jason", "Mikel", "Evdacim"]
Checking the "Muara":
Doesn't start with a "J"
Muara has no friends in the dictionary
Queue: ["Jon", "I", "Jason", "Mikel", "Evdacim"]
Checking out "Jon":
Starts with "J" → this is the best friend!
We output the message and return True
# Execution example for breadth_first_search("Potur"):
Initial queue: ["Artem", "Katya", "Maksim"]
Checking out "Artem":
Doesn't start with a "J"
Artem has no friends in the dictionary
Queue: ["Katya", "Maksim"]
Checking out "Katya":
Doesn't start with a "J"
Katya has no friends in the dictionary
Queue: ["Maksim"]
Checking "Maksim":
Doesn't start with a "J"
Maksim has no friends in the dictionary
The queue is empty - we return False (no best friend found)

# Why does BFS work?
BFS ensures that we first check all the friends of the initial person (level 1), then all their friends (level 2), and so on. This means that we will find the closest (with the least degree of separation) best friend.

# The time complexity of the breadth—first search algorithm (BFS) is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.  

This estimate is valid for the best, average, and worst cases.  2
Analysis of working hours:
Working with a queue. Queued and dequeued operations take O(1) time, so the total time spent working with the queue is O(V) operations. 1
Working with the ribs. For each vertex, no more than a certain number of incident edges are considered. Since the total number of edges is 2E, the time used to work with the edges is O(E). 1
Thus, the total running time of the BFS algorithm is O(V + E). 1
